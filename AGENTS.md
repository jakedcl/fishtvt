# AGENTS.md — fishtvt

## Dev framework

This repo follows Jake's dev framework: [jakedcl/dev-framework](https://github.com/jakedcl/dev-framework) (start at its `AGENTS.md`). The framework is the source of truth; if anything in this file conflicts with it, the framework wins.

The framework repo is private. Cloud agents open it with `git clone --depth 1 https://x-access-token:${DEV_FRAMEWORK_READ_TOKEN}@github.com/jakedcl/dev-framework /tmp/dev-framework` (the token is a Cursor secret; never print or commit it).

## Repo facts
